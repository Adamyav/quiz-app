Features:
The user has to click on the start button to start the quiz. 
The question cards will be displayed one by one and each question has a timer of 10 seconds. Each question has 4 options which will be jumbled after each game. User can navigate to the next question either by clicking next or when the timer goes off.
The user gets notified if their answer is correct or wrong and will be given 1 point for correct answer and no point for a wrong answer.
At the end of the game the total score of the user is displayed and also an option to restart the quiz.


Working:
There are respective functions for each of the tasks--like displaying the entry point of the quiz, navigation to the next question, checking the correctness of the answers, timer functionality, jumbling the questions and also their respective options on each quiz loading and restarting the quiz. These manipulate the content to be displayed on the screen using HTML and CSS.

Further scope:
We can create quiz options with varying difficulty level options which the user can select. We can also increase the repository of questions and also create a database for storing the user progress and displaying it on the screen.
